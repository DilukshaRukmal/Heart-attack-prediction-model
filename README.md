binary prediction model using matlab ▶️:

**Kaggle Dataset:** [Heart Attack](https://www.example.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset)

---

## 1. Age : Age of the patient

## 2. Sex : Sex of the patient

## 3. cp : Chest Pain type

Value 0: typical angina

Value 1: atypical angina

Value 2: non-anginal pain

Value 3: asymptomatic

## 4. trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

## 5. chol: cholesterol in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

## 6. fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)

1 = true

0 = false

## 7. rest_ecg: resting electrocardiographic results
Value 0: normal

Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

## 8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved

## 9. exang: exercise induced angina

1 = yes

0 = no

## 10. old peak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

## 11. slp: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

0 = unsloping

1 = flat

2 = downsloping

## 12. caa: number of major vessels (0-3)

## 13. thall : thalassemia

0 = null

1 = fixed defect

2 = normal

3 = reversable defect

## output: diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
0: < 50% diameter narrowing. less chance of heart disease

1: > 50% diameter narrowing. more chance of heart disease
